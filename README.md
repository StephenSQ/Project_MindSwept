# Project_MindSwept

My first attempt in making a complete website which happens to be a simple minesweeper web game - first made in CodePen.  
This is a repo where I put a copy of it and I'm also using this to practice using Git and Github.  

Here's the full website on [CodePen.](https://codepen.io/stephensq/full/PoabeJm "The Full Page View")  
Here's the one with [Its code.](https://codepen.io/stephensq/pen/PoabeJm "Along With Its Code")

That's all I have to say, now I'll use this readme file to practice markdown syntax

## two dashes for a subheader huh ?

*one asterisk on both sides for italics ?* alright.  
**double asterisk on both sides for bold ?** got it.  
***three asterisk for bold AND italics ???*** yessir.

> ### Oo so these things are called blockquotes ?

> damn alright, add a ">" symbol at the start of a paragraph for blockquotes.
>> woah ">>" for a nested one ? damnn alright.  
>> - Dashes asterisks and plus symbols for lists...  
>> 1. can also use numbers for an ordered list...
>>    and 4 consecutive spaces or a tab for an indent.  
> nc nc

### Backticks to make code snippets ?

`printf("nice stuff.");`

#### code blocks with 4 space indents or enclose it with triple backticks and optionaly specify its language for syntax highlighting ?

```html
<body>  
    <h1>html header be like :</h1>
</body
```
woah how nice :)

## Alright. Now on to links :

The text to be linked are enclosed with [ ] immidiately followed by a ( ) to enclose the link.  
Here's where I learned this :( ) 
[Markdown Syntax Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links "add a link title to appear upon hover with quotation marks :() HOW AMAZING IS THAT ?")  
"To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets." :
<https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links>  
<quandale008@goofyahh.com>  
It can also be formatted like usual ***<https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links>***  

### Reference style links !?

"formatted with two sets of brackets. The first set of brackets surrounds the text that should appear linked. The second set of brackets displays a label used to point to the link youâ€™re storing elsewhere in your document."

- *[Mr. White][1]*  
- **[Mr. Saul][2]**  
- ***[The Gus][3]***

"The second part of a reference-style link is formatted with the following attributes:

1. The label, in brackets, followed immediately by a colon and at least one space (e.g., [ label ]: ).
2. The URL for the link, which you can optionally enclose in angle brackets.
3. The optional title for the link, which you can enclose in double quotes, single quotes, or parentheses."

[2]: https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/Jimmy_McGill "I like these three tho"
[3]: https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/Gustavo_Fring "Even at my time their memes are dead already but I bet it lives on just like the franchise :)"

## WOAH IMAGES ???

"To add an image, add an exclamation mark ( ! ), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL."

![This will be the alt text](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gtawiki/images/7/70/CJ-GTASA.png/revision/latest?cb=20190612091918)

"To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses."

# Welp, That'll be it. Took too long to make this, imma leave it be like this.
